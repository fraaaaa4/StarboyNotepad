A little Notepad made completely in Windows XP, Office 2003 and Visual Basic 6. Why did I choose to do it like that? Just to have some fun!

It was set firstly as a challenge for a friend of mine, but after some time I decided too to take on the challenge of making a notepad, because otherwise I would have felt really bored during summer. It's not an extremely complicated program, but it's basically my first ever Visual Basic application fully developed.
It has three versions: Starboy Notepad (32-bit), Starboy Notepad/16, and Starboy/DOS, each one for three different architectures.

# 32-bit version
It is the main version of Starboy Notepad, and the one that will run on most computers.

It features many features, such as open ad save, different fonts, different colours, alignment and bullets. It's still though not finished, but it's very promising! It features also a splash screen, and when you don't have all the tools available, another window pops up. It should run fine on Windows XP or superior.

# 16-bit version

A 16-bit version is now available too. Developed on Windows NT 3.5/ME and Visual Basic 4.0, it currently works only on the 9x kernnel, so it's the perfect fit for those old systems.

It can currently run only on Windows 9x systems, so systems that run Windows 95, 98 and ME. It is a bit more basic than the 32-bit version, but it still features all the most important features of the 32-bit version, such as fonts, colours, and open and save file. It does still feature some bugs due to the fact that it was built with Visual Basic 4, such as alignment not working.

# DOS version

There is now available a DOS version, Starboy/DOS! It is a bit different from the 32/16-bit ersions, as it doesn't include only the notepad, but many apps together. This was done due to the fact that DOS doesn't feature multitasking, so you wouldn't be able to use other programs while on Starboy/DOS you can! Inside the app, it runs multiple windows, which do include apps such as Notepad, Calculator, Clock and Search.
