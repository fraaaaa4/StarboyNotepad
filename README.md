A little Notepad made completely in Windows XP, Office 2003 and Visual Basic 6. Why did I choose to do it like that? Just to have some fun!

It was set firstly as a challenge for a friend of mine, but after some time I decided too to take on the challenge of making a notepad, because otherwise I would have felt really bored during summer. It's not an extremely complicated program, but it's basically my first ever Visual Basic application fully developed.

# 16-bit version
A 16-bit version is now available too. Developed on Windows NT 3.5/ME and Visual Basic 4.0, it currently works only on the 9x kernnel, so it's the perfect fit for those old systems.

# DOS version
I'm currently thinking on doing a full DOS version too of this, developed with Visual Basic 1.0 for DOS.
